# State

### Intro to hooks

Hooks were added to React in version `16.8.`

Hooks allow function components to have access to `state` and other React features. Because of this, `class` components are generally no longer needed.

Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.


### Hook `useState` 
The React `useState` Hook allows us to track state in a function component.

State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.
